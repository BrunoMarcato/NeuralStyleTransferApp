Paper for this project can be acessed in [here](SI2_Paper_StyleTransfer.pdf)

---

To install dependencies, run the command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

---

To train new models use the file [train](https://github.com/BrunoMarcato/NeuralStyleTransferApp/blob/main/train_model/train.py), changing the necessary parameters at the beginning of the code. 
A log will be generated in tensorboard to monitor content and style losses.
